# Project Light - Python Dependencies

# --- Core Libraries ---
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.0 # For CV operations (headless for server/RPi without GUI)
numpy>=1.20.0                # Fundamental package for numerical computation
pyserial>=3.5                # For potential future serial communication with hardware

# --- AI Vision Stack ---
# Assuming you were using EasyOCR and then switched to pytesseract
# If you are sticking with Tesseract:
Pillow>=9.0.0                # Required by pytesseract for image handling
pytesseract>=0.3.8           # Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR engine

# If you want to include EasyOCR (optional, if you revert or explore later)
# easyocr>=1.4.0             # Deep learning based OCR. Can be heavy.

# --- AI Audio Stack ---
pyaudio>=0.2.11              # For audio input/output
scipy>=1.7.0                 # For scientific computing, especially FFT in audio analysis
tensorflow>=2.5.0            # Core TensorFlow library (needed for YAMNet)

# --- General Utilities (potentially used implicitly or explicitly) ---
# Consider adding specific versions if you encounter issues, e.g.,
# Flask>=2.0.0               # If you add any web interface or API (future scope)
